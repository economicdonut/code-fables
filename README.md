# code-fables

Welcome to our Web Application Development 2 Project! We are team Udni, from G3 Singapore Management University.

Code-fables is a gamified coding website aimed towards kids, that faces the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4: Quality Education. Our group noticed that there was a lack of available resources to children in between Scratch and Full-on coding, and we aim to bridge that gap.
